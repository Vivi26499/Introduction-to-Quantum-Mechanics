# Project Description

This repository contains my notes and exercises from **_Introduction to Quantum Mechanics_** by **David J. Griffiths**.

Originally written in LaTeX, I am currently in the process of rewriting them using **Typst** â€” a modern typesetting system that offers improved readability, faster compilation, and a more streamlined syntax.
